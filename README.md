## How to Run  
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.  
2. Open the `ARIMA FINAL.r` or `VARS FINAL.r` scripts in RStudio or your preferred R environment.  
3. Ensure the `ESS data.csv` file is in the same directory.  
4. Execute the scripts to perform time series analysis and view results.
